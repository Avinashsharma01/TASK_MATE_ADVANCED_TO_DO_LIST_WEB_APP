## CHAPTER – I: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Abstract

Task Mate is an advanced to-do list web application designed to enhance productivity and task management through a modern, intuitive interface. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), it offers a comprehensive solution for managing daily tasks with features such as categorization, due dates, search functionality, and real-time browser notifications for task reminders.

The application implements a secure user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Token), allowing users to maintain their personal task lists safely. The responsive design ensures the application works seamlessly across various devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones, making task management accessible anywhere, anytime.

A key innovation of Task Mate is its reminder notification system, which uses browser notifications to alert users about upcoming tasks. This feature addresses the common problem of forgetting important tasks by providing timely reminders, which significantly enhances the usability of the application compared to traditional to-do lists.

The project demonstrates the implementation of modern web development practices, including state management with React Context API, component-based architecture, responsive design with Tailwind CSS, and RESTful API design. The development process followed a user-centered design approach, ensuring that the final product meets real user needs in task management.

### 1.2 Background of Present Work

Task management has evolved significantly over the years, from paper-based lists to digital solutions. While there are numerous task management applications available, many lack intuitive interfaces or essential features like reminder notifications, or they are overly complex for everyday use.

Traditional to-do list applications often suffer from several limitations:

-   Lack of notification systems for upcoming tasks
-   Limited categorization and organization capabilities
-   Poor user interface and experience on different devices
-   Insufficient search and filtering functionality
-   Absence of real-time updates and synchronization

Task Mate was developed to address these limitations by providing a user-friendly application that combines essential task management features with an advanced reminder system. The application leverages modern web technologies to deliver a smooth user experience while ensuring data security and privacy.

The reminder feature, in particular, addresses a critical gap in many existing solutions. By implementing browser notifications, Task Mate helps users stay on track with their tasks without requiring them to actively check the application. This proactive approach to task management significantly improves user productivity and task completion rates.

## CHAPTER – III: WORKING PRINCIPLE

The Task Mate application operates on a client-server architecture following the MERN stack paradigm. The core functionality is divided into several interconnected modules that work together to provide a seamless task management experience.

### System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer (React Frontend)**

    - Responsible for rendering the user interface
    - Manages local state and user interactions
    - Communicates with the back-end through API calls

2. **Application Layer (Express.js Backend)**

    - Handles HTTP requests and routes
    - Implements business logic and data validation
    - Manages authentication and authorization

3. **Data Layer (MongoDB)**
    - Stores user data, task information, and application state
    - Provides data persistence and retrieval capabilities

### Authentication Flow

1. User registration or login triggers an authentication request
2. Server validates credentials and issues a JWT token
3. Token is stored in local storage and included in subsequent API requests
4. Protected routes check token validity before processing requests
5. Expired tokens trigger a logout or refresh flow

### Task Management Process

1. **Task Creation**

    - User enters task details (title, description, category, due date)
    - Optional reminder settings are configured
    - Form data is validated and sent to the server
    - Server creates a task record associated with the user
    - UI updates to show the new task

2. **Task Retrieval and Display**

    - Application fetches tasks from the server on initialization
    - Tasks are filtered and sorted according to user preferences
    - Components render task cards with appropriate status indicators
    - Search and filter functionality narrows down displayed tasks

3. **Task Updates and Completion**
    - User modifies task details or marks tasks as complete
    - Changes are sent to the server and reflected in the database
    - UI updates to show the current state of tasks

### Reminder System Operation

The reminder system is a key component of Task Mate, operating through the following process:

1. **Setting Reminders**

    - User creates or edits a task with a reminder date and time
    - Reminder information is stored with the task in the database

2. **Reminder Service Initialization**

    - When the application loads, the reminder service starts
    - Service requests notification permissions if not already granted
    - An interval is set to regularly check for due reminders

3. **Checking for Due Reminders**

    - At regular intervals, the service fetches current tasks
    - Each task with an enabled reminder is evaluated
    - Date and time comparison determines if a reminder is due

4. **Notification Delivery**

    - Browser notifications are created for due reminders
    - Notifications include task title and description
    - Tasks are marked as "notified" to prevent duplicate alerts

5. **User Interaction with Notifications**
    - Clicking a notification brings the user back to the application
    - Tasks remain visible in the list even after notification

The reminder service implements robust date handling to account for different time zones and formats. It includes error handling and logging to ensure reliable operation even under edge cases.

### Data Flow and State Management

Task Mate uses the React Context API for state management, with two primary contexts:

1. **Authentication Context**

    - Manages user authentication state
    - Provides login, register, and logout functions
    - Maintains current user information

2. **Task Context**
    - Stores and manages the user's tasks
    - Provides functions for task CRUD operations
    - Handles task filtering, sorting, and searching
    - Manages the reminder service initialization

This approach allows for efficient component rendering and avoids prop drilling while maintaining a clear data flow throughout the application.
